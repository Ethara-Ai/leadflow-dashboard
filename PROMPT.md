I need you to build me a really nice sales dashboard called LeadFlow. I want it to look modern and premium, the kind of thing you would see at a well-funded startup. Use React with Vite and Tailwind for styling, Framer Motion to make everything feel smooth and alive, Recharts for the graphs, and Lucide for icons.

Starting with the header, put the logo on the left and LeadFlow next to it in bold. On the right side I need a few buttons. First, a toggle to switch between dark and light mode that remembers what the user picked even after they close the browser. Then a refresh button that, when clicked, shows a loading state for a couple seconds like it is fetching fresh data. Next is a notes button that opens up a modal where people can write down notes about their leads and save them or delete old ones. Finally an export button that drops down with options to download everything as CSV or JSON. When someone is on a phone or tablet, hide all those buttons behind a hamburger menu that slides out nicely.

Right under the header I want a welcome message that greets the user and tells them what the dashboard is for. Put a little wave emoji in there. They should be able to close this message, and it should animate away smoothly.

Now for the main stats section. I need four cards in a row, but on phones they should stack into two rows of two. The first card shows Total Leads with a user's icon, displaying something like 2847, and underneath it says "plus 12 percent from last month" in green. The second card is Calls Made with a phone icon showing around 847 plus 8 percent this week. Third is Meetings Scheduled with a calendar icon showing about 156 plus 23 percent. Fourth is Conversion Rate with a trending up icon showing 24.3 percent and plus 3.2 percent versus last month. Each icon should sit in a colored container: blue for leads, green for calls, amber for meetings, and purple for conversion. Make these cards look premium with that frosted glass effect and nice rounded corners, and when you hover over them, they should lift up slightly with a shadow.

Below that I need three charts. The first one is Lead Activity, which combines an area chart showing how many active leads there are with bars showing calls completed. Use blue for the leads area with a nice gradient fill and green for the bars. The second chart is the conversion rate as a simple line chart in amber color tracking the percentage over time. The third is Lead Source Distribution as a donut chart showing where leads come from. Break it down into Website at 35 percent, Referrals at 25 percent, Social Media at 20 percent, Email Campaign at 15 percent, and Direct at 5 percent. Use different colors for each slice so they are easy to tell apart.

Here is the important part for the charts. Each one needs three buttons for Week, Month, and Year. When someone clicks these, it should actually change the data in the chart to show that time period. The selected button should look different, while the others look more subtle.

After the charts I want two panels side by side, but stacked on mobile. On the left put a meeting schedule with a mini calendar. Show the current month and year at the top with arrows to go forward and back through months. Display all the days in a grid and highlight today. If a day has meetings scheduled, put a small dot on it. When someone clicks a day, expand a section below showing what meetings are on that day with the meeting title, client name, time, and whether it is a video call or phone call with the right icon. Also add a plus button that opens a popup form to create a new meeting where they fill in the title, client, date, time, how long it will be, and pick video or phone.

On the right side put a recent activities feed that looks like a timeline. Draw a thin vertical line down the left side, and for each activity show an icon in a colored circle. Phone calls get a phone icon, emails get a mail icon, meetings get a calendar icon, closed deals get a checkmark, new leads get a cyan user plus icon, and proposals get an indigo document icon. For each activity, show what happened in bold, a short description, the lead or company name, and when it happened, like 2 hours ago, over on the right. Some activities can have a priority badge: red for high priority, amber for medium, and gray for low. If it was a closed deal, show the amount in green.

I also need a lead alerts section and a number showing how many alerts there are. Add a plus button to create custom alerts. Show each alert with a colored stripe on the left matching its type: blue for info, amber for warnings, red for errors, and green for success. Display the message and how long ago it was.

For the footer, put the LeadFlow logo on the left that refreshes the page if clicked, with a short tagline about what the platform does. Then have three columns of links for Product with Features and Support, Resources with Community and Case Studies, and Company with Privacy and Terms. When someone clicks these links, open a modal with some placeholder text since we do not have real pages yet. 

The dark mode needs to look really good. Use blackish backgrounds, lighter zinc for text, and add some subtle glow effects on the cards so they pop. Light mode should be clean and bright with white backgrounds and soft gray text. Make sure switching between them is smooth and does not flash.

Everything should animate nicely. When the page loads, the cards and sections should fade in one after another with a slight delay between each. Hovering on cards should feel responsive with quick transitions around 200 milliseconds. While data is loading, show skeleton placeholders that pulse so people know something is happening. Make sure it all works on phones, tablets, and desktops. The layout should adapt nicely without anything looking broken or squished. Add a last updated timestamp centered above the footer that fades in after everything else loads.

For the code structure, organize everything into separate components with their own files. Use React Context to manage the state for things like theme, notes, alerts, modal visibility, and the chart time periods. Create custom hooks to make accessing this state easy. Wrap everything in an error boundary so if something crashes, it shows a nice error message instead of a blank screen. Add PropTypes to all components so the code is easier to maintain. Make sure buttons and interactive elements are keyboard accessible and have proper labels for screen readers. Generate realistic-looking data throughout. The stats should look like a real sales team, the activities should span the last few hours with different types, the calendar should have a handful of meetings on different days this month, and the alerts should have a mix of priorities. Everything needs to actually work, not just look pretty. Clicking buttons should do things, modals should open and close, the calendar should navigate properly, and creating a meeting should add it to the list.
