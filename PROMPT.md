Act as a Senior Lead Frontend Architect to design and implement a production-grade LeadFlow Dashboard using React 19, Vite 7, and Tailwind CSS 4. The goal is to build a high-performance, scalable, and visually refined dashboard that functions like a real-world lead generation and management platform for sales teams, marketing professionals, and business development specialists. Follow a feature-based directory structure with a `src` folder containing `components`, `hooks`, and root utility files such as `constants.js`, `utils.js`, and `chartUtils.js`. Use React Context API for global theme management with light/dark mode persistence via localStorage, backward compatibility through optional `darkMode` props, and graceful handling outside the provider. Implement global document-level styling using a custom hook. Build the main LeadFlow Dashboard component to orchestrate all UI, modal, time-period, and data states, prevent background scrolling when modals are open, simulate real-time data updates with error handling, and render loading, welcome, and error states. Include a fully interactive header with animated action buttons, theme toggle, refresh behavior, notes access, and export dropdown using Framer Motion. For mobile and tablet devices, implement a hamburger menu that consolidates all action buttons with their labels, prevents background scrolling when open, and positions on the same line as the logo. Hide the tagline on small devices and tablets. Apply Tailwind-based glassmorphism styling, responsive layouts, and defined animation variants across all UI elements, adhering strictly to the provided color system, typography, spacing rules, and breakpoint behavior including extra-small device handling.

Develop animated stat cards displaying Total Leads, Calls Made, Meetings Scheduled, and Conversion Rate metrics with trend indicators. Implement three fully featured Recharts-based visualizations with reusable time filters (Week, Month, Year), custom tooltips, legends, gradients, axis styling, and theme-aware behavior, supported by shared utilities in chartUtils. Charts must include a Lead Activity composed chart showing lead volume and engagement metrics, a Conversion Rate area chart with percentage formatting, and a responsive Lead Source Distribution pie chart. The Lead Source Distribution card should display the title centered at top, time period selector below the title, pie chart in the middle, and a legend with complete source names and percentages always visible below the chart. Build a Meeting Schedule card with an interactive calendar view supporting click-to-expand meeting details below the specific date row, month navigation, dynamic meeting counts per month displayed in the footer, list view toggle showing all meetings for the currently displayed month, and meeting data spanning multiple past and future months. Calendar dates without scheduled meetings should not display cursor pointer styling. Include a Recent Lead Activities panel showing latest lead interactions with status indicators. Build a robust Lead Alerts panel with animated lists, dropdown input for adding alerts, empty states, type-based styling (info, warning, error), and improved padding and spacing between alert items. Implement a notes system for documenting lead interactions and follow-up tasks with add, view, and delete functionality with animated transitions. Include reusable modal infrastructure for footer sections (Product, Resources, Company) with proper mobile visibility, scrollable content areas, and safe area support for modern devices. Ensure modals are completely visible on mobile devices with appropriate max-height adjustments and touch-friendly scrolling. Ensure the page is scrollable to the footer section on mobile devices. Provide realistic mock initialization data for lead metrics, charts, meeting schedules, alerts, activities, and notes, along with fully functional CSV/JSON export utilities that bundle all dashboard data with timestamped filenames. Ensure all components are documented with JSDoc, animations use Framer Motion variants as specified, and the overall experience feels polished, professional, and production-ready for sales and business development professionals.
