Act as a Senior Lead Frontend Architect to design and implement a production-grade Zoolab Dashboard using React 19, Vite 7, and Tailwind CSS 4. The goal is to build a high-performance, scalable, and visually refined dashboard that functions like a real-world zoo management product. Follow a feature-based directory structure with a `src` folder containing `components`, `hooks`, and root utility files such as `constants.js`, `utils.js`, and `chartUtils.js`. Use React Context API for global theme management with light/dark mode persistence via localStorage, backward compatibility through optional `darkMode` props, and graceful handling outside the provider. Implement global document-level styling using a custom hook. Build the main ZoolabDashboard component to orchestrate all UI, modal, time-period, and data states, prevent background scrolling when modals are open, simulate real-time data updates with error handling, and render loading, welcome, and error states. Include a fully interactive header with animated action buttons, theme toggle, refresh behavior, notes access, and export dropdown using Framer Motion. Apply Tailwind-based glassmorphism styling, responsive layouts, and defined animation variants across all UI elements, adhering strictly to the provided color system, typography, spacing rules, and breakpoint behavior including extra-small device handling.

Develop animated stat cards, alerts management, notes modal system, footer with modal-driven content sections, and comprehensive loading states. Implement three fully featured Recharts-based visualizations with reusable time filters, custom tooltips, legends, gradients, axis styling, and theme-aware behavior, supported by shared utilities in chartUtils. Charts must include an activity composed chart, a feeding efficiency line chart with percentage formatting, and a responsive diet distribution pie chart with adaptive labels and legends. Build a robust alerts panel with animated lists, dropdown input, empty states, and type-based styling, alongside a notes system that supports adding, viewing, and deleting observations with animated transitions. Include reusable modal infrastructure for footer sections, realistic mock initialization data for metrics, charts, alerts, and notes, and fully functional CSV/JSON export utilities that bundle all dashboard data with timestamped filenames. Ensure all components are documented with JSDoc, animations use Framer Motion variants as specified, and the overall experience feels polished, professional, and production-ready for zoo management professionals.
